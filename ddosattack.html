<h4>What is a DDOS Attack?</h4>
<p>DDoS is short for Distributed Denial of Service.
 DDoS is a type of DOS(Denial of Service) attack where multiple compromised systems, which are often 
infected with a Trojan, are used to target a single system causing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
 Victims of a DDoS attack consist of both the end targeted system and all systems
maliciously used and controlled by the hacker in the distributed attack. </p>

<h4>How does a DDOS attack work</h4>
<p>In a DDoS attack, the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates
 from many different sources;potentially hundreds of thousands or more.
 This effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack simply by blocking
 a single IP address; plus, it is very difficult to distinguish legitimate
 user traffic from attack traffic when spread across so many points of origin.</p>

<h4>A few types of DDOS attacks</h4>
<ol>
<li>HTTP Flood -  This attack uses an extremely large number of HTTP GET or POST requests,that are seemingly 
legitimate,to target an application or web server. These requests are often crafted to avoid detection 
with the perpetrator having gained useful information regarding a target prior to the attack.</li>
<li>DNS Amplification - An attack in which the attacker exploits vulnerabilites in domain name system(DNS)
servers to turn initially small queries into much larger payloads, which are used to bring down the victim's servers.</li>
<li>UDP FLOOD - a type of denial-of-service attack in which a large number of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets are sent to a targeted server
with the aim of overwhelming that device's ability to process and respond</li>
<li>DNS FLOOD - attack in which the attacker targets one or more Domain Name System (DNS) servers belonging to 
a given zome, attempting to hamper resolution of resource records of that zone and its sub-zones.  These attacks 
attempt to exhaust server-side assets (e.g., memory or CPU) with a flood of UDP requests, generated by scripts 
running on several compromised botnet machines. </li>
<li>Ping Flood - an attack in which an attacker takes down a victim's computer by overwhelming it with ICMP echo
requests, also known as pings. The attack involves flooding the victim’s network with request packets, knowing 
that the network will respond with an equal number of reply packets. Additional methods for bringing down a target
 with ICMP requests include the use of custom tools or code, such as hping and scapy. </li>
</ol>
