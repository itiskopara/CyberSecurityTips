<h3><center>DDOS Attacks</center></h3>
<h4>What is a DDOS Attack?</h4>
<p>DDoS is short for Distributed Denial of Service.
 DDoS is a type of DOS(Denial of Service) attack where multiple compromised systems, which are often
infected with a Trojan, are used to target a single system causing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
 Victims of a DDoS attack consist of both the end targeted system and all systems
maliciously used and controlled by the hacker in the distributed attack. </p>

<h4>How does a DDOS attack work?</h4>
<p>In a DDoS attack, the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates
 from many different sources;potentially hundreds of thousands or more.
 This effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack simply by blocking
 a single IP address; plus, it is very difficult to distinguish legitimate
 user traffic from attack traffic when spread across so many points of origin.</p>

<h4>A few types of DDOS attacks</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>HTTP Flood</strong> -  This attack uses an extremely large number of HTTP GET or POST requests,that are seemingly
legitimate,to target an application or web server. These requests are often crafted to avoid detection
with the perpetrator having gained useful information regarding a target prior to the attack.</li>
<li><strong>DNS Amplification</strong> - An attack in which the attacker exploits vulnerabilites in domain name system(DNS)
servers to turn initially small queries into much larger payloads, which are used to bring down the victim's servers.</li>
<li><strong>UDP FLOOD</strong> - a type of denial-of-service attack in which a large number of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets are sent
to a targeted server
with the aim of overwhelming that device's ability to process and respond</li>
<li><strong>DNS FLOOD</strong> - attack in which the attacker targets one or more Domain Name System (DNS) servers belonging to
a given zome, attempting to hamper resolution of resource records of that zone and its sub-zones.  These attacks
attempt to exhaust server-side assets (e.g., memory or CPU) with a flood of UDP requests, generated by scripts
running on several compromised botnet machines. </li>
<li><strong>Ping Flood</strong> - an attack in which an attacker takes down a victim's computer by overwhelming it with ICMP echo
requests, also known as pings. The attack involves flooding the victim's network with request packets, knowing
that the network will respond with an equal number of reply packets. Additional methods for bringing down a target
 with ICMP requests include the use of custom tools or code, such as hping and scapy. </li>
</ol>

<h4>How to Defend Against a DDOS attack</h4>

<h4>Reduce Attack Surface Area</h4>
<p>One of the first techniques to mitigate DDoS attacks is to minimize the surface area that can be attacked thereby limiting the
  options for attackers and allowing you to build protections in a single place. We want to ensure that we do not expose our
  application or resources to ports, protocols or applications from where they do not expect any communication. Thus, minimizing
  the possible points of attack and letting us concentrate our mitigation efforts. In some cases, you can do this by placing your
  computation resources behind Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) or Load Balancers and restricting direct Internet traffic to
  certain parts of your infrastructure like your database servers. In other cases, you can use firewalls or Access Control Lists
  (ACLs) to control what traffic reaches your applications.</p>

<h4>Plan for Scale</h4>

<p>The two key considerations for mitigating large scale volumetric DDoS attacks are bandwidth (or transit) capacity and server
 capacity to absorb and mitigate attacks.</p>

<p>Transit capacity. When architecting your applications, make sure your hosting provider provides ample redundant Internet
connectivity that allows you to handle large volumes of traffic. Since the ultimate objective of DDoS attacks is to affect
the availability of your resources/applications, you should locate them, not only close to your end users but also to large
Internet exchanges which will give your users easy access to your application even during high volumes of traffic. Additionally,
web applications can go a step further by employing Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) and smart DNS resolution services
which provide an additional layer of network infrastructure for serving content and resolving DNS queries from locations
that are often closer to your end users.</p>

<p>Server capacity. Most DDoS attacks are volumetric attacks that use up a lot of resources; it is, therefore, important that you
  can quickly scale up or down on your computation resources. You can either do this by running on larger computation resources
  or those with features like more extensive network interfaces or enhanced networking that support larger volumes. Additionally,
  it is also common to use load balancers to continually monitor and shift loads between resources to prevent overloading any
  one resource.</p>

<h4>Know what is normal and abnormal traffic</h4>
<p>Whenever we detect elevated levels of traffic hitting a host, the very baseline is to be able only to accept as much traffic as
  our host can handle without affecting availability. This concept is called rate limiting. More advanced protection techniques
  can go one step further and intelligently only accept traffic that is legitimate by analyzing the individual packets themselves.
  To do this, you need to understand the characteristics of good traffic that the target usually receives and be able to compare
  each packet against this baseline.</p>


<h4>Deploy Firewalls for sophisticated Application attacks</h4>
<p>A good practice is to use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) against attacks, such as SQL injection or cross-site request forgery,
  that attempt to exploit a vulnerability in your application itself. Additionally,due to the unique nature of these attacks, you
  should be able to easily create customized mitigations against illegitimate requests which could have characteristics like
  disguising as good traffic or coming from bad IPs, unexpected geographies, etc. At times it might also be helpful in mitigating
  attacks as they happen to get experienced support to study traffic patterns and create customized protections.</p>
