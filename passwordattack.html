<h4>What is a Password Attack</h4>
<p>Because passwords are the most commonly used mechanism to authenticate users to an information 
system, obtaining passwords is a common and effective attack approach. Access to a person’s password
 can be obtained by looking around the person’s desk, ‘‘sniffing’’ the connection to the network to
acquire unencrypted passwords, using social engineering, gaining access to a password database or 
outright guessing.</p>

<h4>Types of Password Attacks</h4>
<ul>
<li>Brute-force: password guessing means using a random approach by trying different passwords and 
hoping that one works. Some logic can be applied by trying passwords related to the person’s name, 
job title, hobbies or similar items.</li>
<li>Dictionary Attack:  a dictionary of common passwords is used to attempt to gain access to a 
user’s computer and network. One approach is to copy an encrypted file that contains the passwords,
 apply the same encryption to a dictionary of commonly used passwords, and compare the results.</li>
<li>Fingerprint attack – This is a fairly new type of attack, and its method is fairly sophisticated.
 It breaks possible passphrases down into “fingerprints,” single- and multi-character combinations
 that a user might choose. For the word “dog,” the technique would create fingerprints including
 “d,” “o,” “g,” along with “do,” and “og.”</li>
<li>Mask attack – Similar to a brute-force attack, but with rules to reduce the number of errant 
entries. It’s extremely useful if some of the characters are known, or if character types are
 known. For instance, if a user knows that his password has a capital letter at the beginning and
 three numbers at the end, the mask attack would be far more effective than a simple brute-force
 attack. The masks are often generated by the password cracker.</li>
<li>Permutation attack – A permutation attack uses a dictionary, but each entry in the dictionary 
also generates permutations of itself. For the word “dog,” a permutation attack would create the 
candidates “god,” “ogd,” “odg,” “gdo,” and “dgo.”</li>
<li>Hybrid Attack - A blend of both a dictionary method as well as brute force attack. This means while a
dictionary method would include a wordlist of passwords, the brute-force attack would be applied to each possible 
password in that list.</li>
</ul>

<h4>How to prevent password attacks</h4>

<ol>
<li>Control physical access to systems<br>The security architect needs to take into consideration in 
his or her designs that if an attacker has unrestricted physical access to a computer, the attacker 
owns it.</li>
<li>Use account lockout controls: Account lockout controls help prevent online password attacks. They 
lock an account after the incorrect password is entered a predefined number of times. It's common to 
allow a user to incorrectly enter the password as many as five times before the account is locked out.
 For systems and services that do not support account lockout controls, such as most FTP servers, the 
security practitioner should employ extensive logging and an intrusion detection system to look for 
evidence of password attacks.</li>
<li>Encrypt password files:  Protecting against access control-based password attacks requires that the
 security professional implement numerous security precautions. The security practitioner should encrypt
 password files with the strongest encryption available for the operating systems under management.
 One-way encryption (hashing) is commonly used for passwords instead of storing them in plain text. 
In addition, rigid control over all media containing a copy of the password database file, such as 
backup tapes or repair disks, should be maintained. </li>
<li>Use password masking: The security practitioner should ensure that applications never display 
passwords in cleartext on any screen. Instead, mask the display of the password by displaying an 
alternate character such as asterisk (*). This reduces shoulder surfing attempts, but users should 
be aware that an attacker may be able to watch the keystrokes to discover the password.</li>
