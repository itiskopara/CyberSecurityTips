<h3>What is Phishing</h3>
<p>Phishing is a cybercrime in which a target or targets are
 contacted by email, telephone or text message by someone posing
as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing
sensitive data such as personally identifiable information, banking
and credit card details, and passwords.The information is then used to
 access important accounts and can result in identify theft and finacial loss.</p>

<h3>Features of a Phishing Email</h5>

<ol>
<li><strong>Too Good To Be True:</strong> Lucrative offers and eye-catching or attention-grabbing statements
 are designed to attract people's attention immediately. For instance, many claim that you
have won an iPhone, a lottery, or some other lavish prize. Just don't click on any suspicious emails.
 Remember that if it seems to good to be true, it probably is!</li>
<li><strong>Sense of Urgency:</strong> A favorite tactic amongst cybercriminals is to ask you to act fast because the
 super deals are only for a limited time. Some of them will even tell you that you have only a
 few minutes to respond. When you come across these kinds of emails, it's best to just ignore them.
 Sometimes, they will tell you that your account will be suspended unless you update your personal details
 immediately. Most reliable organizations give ample time before they terminate an account and they never
 ask patrons to update personal details over the Internet. When in doubt, visit the source directly rather
  than clicking a link in an email.</li>
<li><strong>Hyperlinks:</strong> A link may not be all it appears to be. Hovering over a link shows you the actual URL where
 you will be directed upon clicking on it. It could be completely different or it could be a popular
 website with a misspelling, for instance www.bankofarnerica.com - the 'm' is actually an 'r' and
an 'n', so look carefully.</li>
<li><strong>Attachments:</strong> If you see an attachment in an email you weren't expecting or that doesn't make sense,
 don't open it! They often contain payloads like ransomware or other viruses. The only file type that is
always safe to click on is a .txt file.</li>
<li><strong>Unusual Sender:</strong> Whether it looks like it's from someone you don't know or someone you do know, if
anything seems out of the ordinary, unexpected, out of character or just suspicious in general don't
 click on it!
</li>
