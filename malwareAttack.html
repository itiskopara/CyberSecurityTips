<h2><center>Malware Attack</center></h2>
<h4>What is a Malware Attack</h4>
<p>Malware, short for malicious software, can easily be described as unwanted software that
is installed in your system without your consent. Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses are examples
of malicious software that are often grouped together and referred to as malware. </p>

<p>With so many people routinely surfing the Web, malware is often unwittingly spread
across the Internet. Once you enter a compromised website, your system can easily be contaminated
after clicking on malicious links present and malware can be
installed on your computer without your knowledge.</p>

<p>Malware is an easy method of mass infection; compromising one website is easier than sending several
 emails. It targets all visitors/victims that visit a site and click on desirable links, converting their
 systems to act on the attacker's behalf. </p>

<h4>A Few Types of Malware Attacks</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Virus:</strong> One of the most widely discussed types of malware is the virus. A virus is a malicious
 computer program used to alter the way the computer operates, and capable of replicating itself and
 spreading to other devices. These can infect documents, script files, web applications, and other
 various programs.</li>
<li><strong>Spyware:</strong> malware designed to spy on and gather information about the user. It can be used to track
 and monitor Internet activity, discover and extract sensitive information, and log keystrokes.</li>
<li><strong>Adware:</strong>  a type of malware that automatically delivers advertisements to a user to generate revenue
 for its creator. This can be done through pop-up internet ads or ads embedded in the interface of a
 program. Adware is popularly used in conjunction with spyware.</li>
<li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> a type of malware that can restrict users from accessing a system or data, and even
delete or publish data if a ransom is not paid. It can restrict a user from access to files through
encryption. There is still no guarantee that paying the desired ransom will restore systems or data</li>
<li><strong>Trojan Horse:</strong> Attackers disguise this malware as something desirable such as a special offer or gift,
to infiltrate a computer system they otherwise would not have access to. A Trojan Horse can often share
the same competences as other malware including, spyware and adware causing enormous problems for the
user. Once granted access, this malware can steal sensitive data, crash devices, control the system remotely,
and spread itself across networks.</li>

<li><strong>Worm:</strong> A worm is like a virus in the way it can replicate itself to infect other computer systems. However,
 unlike a virus, a worm doesn't need to be attached to an existing program or be prompted to execute.
 A virus requires human intervention to become attached to a file, attachment, or website link while
 a worm can attach itself and self-propagate.</li>

</ul>

<p> Malware can be distributed through code on a website.Once you've been exposed to an attack
a download is activated through an exploit kit. That download can then infect a user's computer
to corrupt it, or steal information.</p>


<h4>Way to prevent Malware Attacks</h4>

<ol>
<li><strong>Don't click embedded links within pop-up windows:</strong> Pop-up windows can include
spyware just by clicking the link or window, accidentally installing spyware to the
 computer. Avoiding these links can prevent an accidental download.</li>

<li><strong>Only download from known, credible websites:</strong> Unknown websites are common grounds for
 adware, therefore users should be vigilant about the locations from where they are downloading
 items.</li>

<li><strong>Back-up data offline daily:</strong> An infected system cannot compromise data that has been backed up
 offline. Thus, users who experience a ransomware attack will have a complete untouched backup of
 their files, and will not be forced to pay the ransom to receive access to their data.</li>

<li><strong>Carefully read licensing agreements before downloading:</strong> A Trojan Horse can only access a system
 if given permission by the user, therefore it uses deceptive communications in downloads during the
 agreement section. Use caution to avoid accidentally downloading something that could cause harm to
 your computer.</li>

<li><strong>Only join secure networks:</strong> Using an open Wi-Fi connection puts a system at risk of a virus by allowing
 unauthorized users and systems to access files. Only use secure networks or VPNs when in public locations.</li>

<li><strong>Use the appropriate firewall:</strong> By implementing a firewall, a user can limit or restrict network traffic,
especially unauthorized users.</li>
