<h3><center>Man In The Middle Attack</center></h3>

<h4>What is a Man In the Middle Attack</h4>
<p>A man in the middle (MITM) attack is a general term for when a perpetrator positions himself in a 
conversation between a user and an application—either to eavesdrop or to impersonate one of the parties, 
making it appear as if a normal exchange of information is underway. </p>

<p>The goal of an attack is to steal personal information, such as login credentials, account details and 
credit card numbers. Targets are typically the users of financial applications, SaaS businesses, 
e-commerce sites and other websites where logging in is required.</p>

<p>Information obtained during an attack could be used for many purposes, including identity theft,
 unapproved fund transfers or an illicit password change.</p>

<h4> Types of Man in Middle Attack below</h4>

<p><strong>Rogue Access Point</strong>: Devices equipped with wireless cards will often try to 
auto connect to the access point that is emitting the strongest signal. 
Attackers can set up their own wireless access point and trick nearby devices 
to join its domain. All of the victim’s network traffic can now be manipulated by
 the attacker. This is dangerous because the attacker does not even have to be on
 a trusted network to do this—the attacker simply needs a close enough physical
 proximity.</p>

<p><strong>ARP Spoofing</strong>: ARP is the Address Resolution Protocol. It is used to resolve IP
 addresses to physical MAC (media access control) addresses in a local area network. When a host needs
 to talk to a host with a given IP address, it references the ARP cache to resolve the IP address to a 
MAC address. If the address is not known, a request is made asking for the MAC address of the device 
with the IP address.</p>

<p>An attacker wishing to pose as another host could respond to requests it should not be responding to with
 its own MAC address. With some precisely placed packets, an attacker can sniff the private traffic
 between two hosts. Valuable information can be extracted from the traffic, such as exchange of session
 tokens, yielding full access to application accounts that the attacker should not be able to access. </p>

<p><strong>DNS Spoofing</strong>: Similar to the way ARP resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses on a LAN, DNS resolves 
domain names to IP addresses. When using a DNS spoofing attack, the attacker attempts to introduce 
corrupt DNS cache information to a host in an attempt to access another host using their domain name, 
such as www.onlinebanking.com. This leads to the victim sending sensitive information to a malicious
 host, with the belief they are sending information to a trusted source. An attacker who has already 
spoofed an IP address could have a much easier time spoofing DNS simply by resolving the address of a 
DNS server to the attacker’s address.</p>

<p><strong>mDNS Spoofing</strong>: Multicast DNS is similar to DNS, but it’s done on a local area network (LAN) using 
broadcast like ARP. This makes it a perfect target for spoofing attacks. The local name resolution system
 is supposed to make the configuration of network devices extremely simple. Users don’t have to know 
exactly which addresses their devices should be communicating with; they let the system resolve it for
 them. Devices such as TVs, printers, and entertainment systems make use of this protocol since they are
 typically on trusted networks. When an app needs to know the address of a certain device, such as 
tv.local, an attacker can easily respond to that request with fake data, instructing it to resolve 
to an address it has control over. Since devices keep a local cache of addresses, the victim will now 
see the attacker’s device as trusted for a duration of time. </p>





<h3>Preventing Man-in-The-Middle-Attacks</h3>

<h5>Strong WEP/WAP Encryption on Access Points</h5>

<p>Having a strong encryption mechanism on wireless access points prevents unwanted users from joining 
your network just by being nearby. A weak encryption mechanism can allow an attacker to brute-force his 
way into a network and begin man-in-the-middle attacking. The stronger the encryption implementation, 
the safer.</p>

<h5>Virtual Private Network</h5>
<p>VPNs can be used to create a secure environment for sensitive information within a local area network.
 They use key-based encryption to create a subnet for secure communication. This way, even if an attacker 
happens to get on a network that is shared, he will not be able to decipher the traffic in the VPN.</p>

<h5>Force HTTPS</h5>
<p>HTTPS can be used to securely communicate over HTTP using public-private key exchange. This prevents
 an attacker from having any use of the data he may be sniffing. Websites should only use HTTPS and not
 provide HTTP alternatives. Users can install browser plugins to enforce always using HTTPS on requests.</p>

<h5>Public Key Pair Based Authentication</h5>
<p>Man-in-the-middle attacks typically involve spoofing something or another. Public key pair based 
authentication like RSA can be used in various layers of the stack to help ensure whether the things 
you are communicating with are actually the things you want to be communicating </p>
